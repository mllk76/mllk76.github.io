<h1 class="txt2">Why are rats so cute?</h1>

	<p>The ‘scientific’ answer is because they have large eyes. Yes, in many cases, large eyes is the ONE thing that all ‘cute’ animals have in common. But in terms of the heart, rats are so cute because… well… they just ARE! Pet rats are so sweet and affectionate and smart and playful and FUN! They have huge sprays of whiskers and adorable ‘hands’ and such pretty fur.</p>
