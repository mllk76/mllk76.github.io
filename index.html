	<p>One of the legends says that a magical camel whose name was Bura lived here, the camel was white as snow and very beautiful. Bura guarded the Burabai place, he always warned the locals about the approach of the enemy with a long drawn-out cry. Therefore, people in this region have always lived in peace and tranquility. One day, robbers came to Burabay, they heard that a magical white camel lives here and they wanted to catch it for a trophy. The robbers set a trap and began to wait for the camel to come to the watering place, when the camel went down the mountain to drink water, the robber shot him with an arrow from a bow. The arrow went through and at that moment the camel turned into a huge rock, and covered the robbers with itself.</p>
